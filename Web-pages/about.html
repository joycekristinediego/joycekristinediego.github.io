                    <p>EVER SINCE I WAS YOUNG MY PARENTS ALWAYS THOUGHT ME DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT LIFE. I WAS BLESSED TO HAVE A VERY SUPPORTIVE FAMILY. </p>
                    <P>WITHOUT MY FAMILY, IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE A HAPPY STUDENT. I AM FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE MOST UNDERSTANDING PARENTS. MY MOTHER IS A HOUSEWIFE AND MY FATHER WORKS AS A ELECTRICIAN IN ONE OF THE COMPANY IN CDO. THEY PUT IN A LOT OF EFFORT TO SUPPORT OUR FAMILY AND TRY TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS THEY CAN GETTING TO KNOW US.</P>
                    <P>LOYALTY AND RESPONSIBILITY ARE IMPORTANT TO MY FAMILY. I USUALLY STRIVE TO BE HONEST WITH MY FAMILY AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT MY ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES. BEING SURROUNDED BY A LOVING FAMILY GIVES ME THE CONFIDENCE TO SET HIGH GOALS FOR MY EDUCATION.</P>
                    <P>YOUNG PEOPLE CAN DO ANYTHING IF WE HAVE A GOOD VIEW ON LIFE. WE ARE CAPABLE OF OVERCOMING OBSTACLES LIKE DEMANDING PROFESSORS OR POOR TIME MANAGEMENT. WE CAN PURSUE OUR GOALS AND ACHIEVE SUCCESS.</P>
